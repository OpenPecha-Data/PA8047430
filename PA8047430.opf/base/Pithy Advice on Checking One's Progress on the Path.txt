To know whether or not you perceive saṃsāra as flawed,Check if you have attachment and desire.


To know whether or not you’ll attain liberation in the next life,Check whether your conduct
is good or bad.

To know whether or not you’ll attain awakening in this life,Check if you display the signs of
progress in generation and completion.

To know whether or not you’ve generated love and compassion,Check how you take care of those
in need.

To know whether or not you’ve tamed the demon[1] of anger,Check how much hatred you foster toward
enemies.

To know whether or not you’ve tamed the ogress[2] of attachment,Check how attached you are to
your loved ones.

To know whether or not you’ve dispelled the obscuring evil[3] of ignorance,Check how much you
cling in hope and fear.

To know whether or not you’ve purified the three poisons,Check how much you've let go of fixation.


You’ll know whether or not your Dharma practice follows the pathBy thoroughly examining your
mind.
