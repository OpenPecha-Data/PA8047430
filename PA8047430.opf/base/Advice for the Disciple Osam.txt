Advice for the Disciple Osam

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Homage to the noble gurus!Inspire me to accomplish goals and aspirations that accord with the
Dharma!

Reflect again and again on the sufferingsOf saṃsāra’s three realms and cultivate a determination
to be free.As it is certain that this precious jewelOf rarely won freedoms and advantages
will soon cease to be,Practice the divinely sacred Dharma with heartfelt sincerity.Whatever
actions you perform, virtuous or harmful,Will certainly bring about their effects,So
it’s crucial that you adopt and avoid causes and results correctly.Develop strong, confident
faith in the sources of refuge,The guru and the Three Jewels.Cultivate a benevolent wish
to benefitAll beings, who are as limitless in number as space is vast.Unless you purify
misdeeds and obscurations in your mindstreamThe experience of primordial wisdom will not
arise,So apply yourself to both accumulation and purification.Unless you have devotion for
the guruYou will not gain the supreme and common attainments,So, strive with sincere commitmentIn
the profound path of guru yoga.Having received secret mantra empowerments,It’s crucial
to practice approach and accomplishment for the yidam deityAnd meditate on the yogas
of the two stages.The genuine nature of the unaltered mindIs only obscured by tight deliberate
focus.When you allow yourself to settle naturally and relax,You’ll experience the natural
state beyond centre and periphery—As open and expansive as space,Unspoilt by the marks
of dualistic perception,A vast experience of naturally arisen clear light,Which transcends
designation and expression.By sustaining this undistractedly while not meditatingAll
deluded thoughts will spontaneously subside.

The reckless and uncouth Chökyi LodröWrote these few words of adviceTo fulfil a request made
from afarBy the faithful student Osam.

May virtue abound!
