Drops of Nectarous Advice

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Having paid homage at the feet of the guru,I shall impart some drops of nectarous advice.

As you have the name of tulku—an emanated form,You cannot be someone emanated through karma,And
must be a higher emanation born of compassion.Still, as you might have flaws, obscurations
from the womb and so on,It is incumbent upon you to train in the path.

For this, maintain the vows of ethical discipline,The commitments that you have already made,And
when in future you receive the vows of a bhikṣu,The root of the teachings, guard them
as you would your very own eyes.For this serves as the foundation of all qualities.

Now, when your mental faculties are bright,Make every effort in study and reflection.Consult
without bias the works of sūtra and mantra,And you’ll thereby gain the light of intelligence.


Then, in order to overcome dualistic fixationAnd gain freedom within the mind’s continuum,It’s
right that you put your energy into meditationAnd discover the key to the profound meaning.


In short, protect your very own mindWith stable mindfulness, vigilance and caution.Distance
yourself from nefarious companions,And train to emulate the excellent lives of the sublime.


These brief words of counselConstitute no more than the merest seed,But you should also consider
the more extensivePratimokṣa Sūtra, Bodhicaryāvatāra and the like.
