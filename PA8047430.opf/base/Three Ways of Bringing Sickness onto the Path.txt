Three Ways of Bringing Sickness onto the Path

by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpé Nyima

There are three ways of bringing sickness onto the path: best, intermediate and inferior.

The best way is simply to leave any intense pain that accompanies your sickness just as it is,
without seeking to remedy it, and by settling into it relaxedly, to allow the essence of
the pain to arise as an experience of emptiness beyond conceptual elaboration.

The intermediate way is to consider that the suffering and harmful influences (dön) that afflict
sentient beings are all included within the intense pain that accompanies your sickness.
Then, by bringing this pain onto the path and eliminating it together with the mental
afflictions, it can become a support for virtuous practice.

The inferior way is to recognise sickness as a repayment for past negative actions. Without
employing any method to alleviate it, do not react with aversion, but understand that it arises
through the compassion of the Three Jewels, and, in this way, you will purify harmful
actions and obscurations.
