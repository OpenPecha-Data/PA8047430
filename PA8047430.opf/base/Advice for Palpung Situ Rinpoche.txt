Advice for Palpung Situ Rinpoche

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ordinary awareness, momentary cognizance,Present knowing that’s not been modified—As long as
its stability hasn't been lost,Simply because it hasn’t slipped away,There’s no room for
going astray.Do you understand, my heart-son?

It is well known that this was given to Palpung Situ Rinpoche.
