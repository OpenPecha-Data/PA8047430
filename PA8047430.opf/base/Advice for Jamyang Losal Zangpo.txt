Advice for Jamyang Losal Zangpo[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Kyeho!Son, constantly recall the guru,And with devotion, as the vital pillar of the path,Recognise
whatever appears as the guru.Then, the wisdom of realization of the great Sakyapa,
your old father,Will be transferred into your mindstream.

Visualize your body as the deity,Integrate your speech into the path through recitation,And
do not let your thoughts and impressions ever strayBeyond the experience of great primordial
wisdom.

To put it simply, what is the point of excessive talk?Tame your own mind, blend your being with
the Dharma,And train constantly in the cultivation of the Dharma’s essence,The two types
of bodhicitta, relative and ultimate.

Thus, Chökyi Lodrö wrote this for the sake of his own student Jamyang Losal Zangpo.[2]
