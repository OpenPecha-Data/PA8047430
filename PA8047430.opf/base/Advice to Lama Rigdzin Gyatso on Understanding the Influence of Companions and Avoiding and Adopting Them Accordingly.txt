Advice to Lama Rigdzin Gyatso

On Understanding the Influence of Companions and Avoiding and Adopting Them Accordingly

by Patrul Rinpoche

The influence of good friends’ behaviour is as follows:The company of the wise increases intelligence.The
company of the compassionate awakens bodhicitta.The company of the contented
reduces desires.The company of the generous inspires a wish to give.The company of the calm
and collected improves one’s own temperament.The company of the disenchanted inspires disillusionment,
andThe company of the renunciant inspires a wish to be free.The company of
those concerned with future lives is a reminder of virtue.The company of the good inspires
the wish for liberation.The company of the dharmic is a reminder to practice Dharma.The
company of those with limited desires inspires contentment.The company of the diligent greatly
strengthens one’s valour.The company of the honourable inspires virtuous qualities.The
company of freedom-seekers encourages the pursuit of lasting happiness.The company of the
virtuous inspires a wholesome attitude.The company of those with pure perception engenders
devotion.The company of the prudent leads to the fulfilment of long-term aspirations.Such
is the behaviour of positive friends.Keep, therefore, to virtuous companions.

The influence of bad friends’ behaviour is as follows:The company of the foolish obscures wisdom.The
company of the aggressive spoils one’s own character.The company of the lustful produces
thoughts of youth.[1]The company of the miserly engenders avarice.The company of the
arrogant induces an attitude of posturing.The company of those without renunciation breeds
attachment to this life.The company of those immersed in this life breeds forgetfulness
of the next.The company of the vulgar inspires thoughts of husbandry and trade.The company
of the wealth-seeking inspires concern for business.The company of the acquisitive brings
thoughts of accumulation and hoarding.The company of the indolent engenders idle discouragement.The
company of the distracted leads to overwhelming diversions.The company of the
fanciful diverts attention toward this life.The company of the wicked inspires an unwholesome
mind.The company of the faithless reduces pure perception.The company of the superficial
triggers nonvirtuous thought.Such is the behaviour of negative associates.Avoid, for these
reasons, unwholesome company.
