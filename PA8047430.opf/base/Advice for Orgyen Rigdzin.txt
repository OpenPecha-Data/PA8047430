Advice for Orgyen Rigdzin

by Palyul Choktrul Jampal Gyepe Dorje

Reflect repeatedly on the rarity of a precious, free and well-favoured human form,And how difficult
it is to find, based on cause, metaphor and numerical statistics.

When you observe that even the vajra form does not endure,The time of death for these suffering
aggregates surely cannot be predicted.

If the lord of victorious ones experiences the effects of positive and negative deeds,We too
will unfailingly encounters the effects of our actionsâ€”that is certain.

Inspired, therefore, by the ultimate aim and intention,Let us, with stable, heartfelt and unshakeable
devotion,View the root guru as an actual buddhaAnd practise blending the mind indivisibly
with his or her wisdom mind.

Do this and you will enter the door to the Dharma,And the purpose of this human life will be
fulfilled.

Written at the request of Orgyen Rigdzin by the one who holds the name of Choktrul.
