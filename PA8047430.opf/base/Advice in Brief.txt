Advice in Brief

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Homage to the guru!

This free and well-favoured human form that you have wonProvides a basis for the attainment
of lasting bliss.

Do not squander it now,
For this marks the dividing line between good and bad.

Do not think of yourself as youthful, my son,
For you’re rapidly approaching your demise.

Analyse and investigate what you’ve seen and heard,And, on top of that, meditate thoroughly
as well.

Examine your actions, the basis for joy and sorrow,And strive to adopt virtue and avoid the
unwholesome.

Contemplate the benefits of liberation, too.And keep the guru’s instructions in your heart,
my son.

Love, compassion, and bodhicitta,Faith, devotion, and samaya—These are the foundations of the
path,So do not disregard them or succumb to idleness.

Abandon deceit, hypocrisy and duplicity,
And do not conceal your own faults.

Since the root of all DharmasDepends on disciplining the mind,Assess the efficacy of Dharma
practicesBy checking how they heal the afflictions.

As the source of all attainments,
You must see the guru as the Buddha.

As the basis of all forms of view and meditation,You must recognise the groundless, rootless
mind-as-such,Perfect its strength, and gain stability.

As the essence of all forms of conduct,You must self-liberate good and bad as of equal taste.


As the source of a positive hereafter,
You must give up attachment to this life.

As a support for all this, rely upon mountain solitude.

Familiarize yourself repeatedly
With the meaning of the sūtras and pith instructions.

Cherish this advice in your heart, my son.

Although I’ve not applied this myself,There’s no fault in offering advice that's beneficial.


In response to your request
I have here written down whatever came to mind.
