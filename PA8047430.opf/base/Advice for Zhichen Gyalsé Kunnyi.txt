Advice for Zhichen Gyalsé Kunnyi

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

I pay homage at the feet of the guru.

Now you have this excellent support, the freedoms and advantages,But it will be difficult to
find such an opportunity again.Do not squander your human life in indolenceAnd end up with
nothing to show for it,But exert yourself, I beg you, in practising sacred Dharma.

Life is impermanent and recedes with each passing moment.Since the virtuous and harmful actions
you accumulateWill accompany you, avoid and adopt causes and effects.And bring to mind
the sufferings of saṃsāra.

Generate bodhicitta as a preliminary to all Dharma.For the main part, whenever accumulating
virtue,Settle in a state beyond reference, without grasping.Seal with dedication free from
three conceptual spheres,And recite prayers of utterly pure aspiration.

Guard this mind of yours at all timesWith mindfulness and vigilance.Bodhicitta is the root of
Dharma.Abandon all the ties of selfishnessAnd apply yourself to benefitting others—this
is crucial.

Since the great spectre of self-clinging,Source of all defects, will bring ruin,Strive to target
all Dharma towards itAnd thoroughly eradicate the demon.

The source of all blessings and attainmentsIs to rely upon the guru, glorious protector,So,
having created a basis of faith and samaya,Generate devotion and receive the blessings.Or
else attainments will be extremely meagre.Strive, therefore, in practice related to the guru.


Thoroughly train this mind of yours.The essence of the teachings is foundIn the practice of
the luminous Great Perfection,The awareness-emptiness of definitive meaning.Apply its key
points and do all that you canTo serve the teachings of the Ancient TranslationsThrough actions
of your body, speech and mind.

The views and writings of Rongzom, Longchenpa,Ngari Paṇchen, Minling Terchen, Jigme Lingpa,
Mipham,And others in this lineage of vidyādharas are immaculate,Untainted by the foul expulsions
of the intellect.Let us aspire that through teaching and through practiceThe works
of this tradition may flourish and spread.

Thus, to fulfil the request of Zhichen Gyalse Kunnyi,Who belongs to the noble family lineage
of Nyang,I, Chökyi Lodrö,Wrote down whatever came to mind. Virtue!
