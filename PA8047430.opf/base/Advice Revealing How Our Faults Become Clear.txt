Namo guru!

I prostrate to the accomplished vidyādhara guru—Bless me so that my mind’s five poisons are
brought onto the path!

Whether the darkness of delusion has been eliminatedIs clear whenever we lie down to sleep at
night.

Whether the flames of anger have been extinguishedIs clear whenever we’re struck by words of
abuse.

Whether the mountain of arrogance has been levelledIs clear whenever we’re honoured by those
of lesser learning.

Whether the lake of desire has dried up and disappearedIs clear whenever we spend time with
a beautiful girl.

Whether the tornado of envy has been brought to an endIs clear whenever our rivals gain the
upper hand.

Whether the tight knot of stinginess has been loosenedIs clear whenever we gain some material
wealth.

Whether the flower of discipline has blossomedIs clear whenever we’re in the midst of common
folk.

Whether we have donned the armour of patienceIs clear whenever adversity strikes all of a sudden.


Whether the steed of diligence has developed to its finestIs clear whenever we set about accomplishing
some virtuous deed.

Whether the fortress of meditation has been securedIs clear whenever serious illness befalls
us.

And whether the sword of wisdom has been sharpenedIs clear whenever the destructive emotions
arise and unfold.

This teaching on how our faults become clear,Was composed by the old beggar called Dündul,In
response to requests from many students.Through the merit of this may all beings become entirely
devoid of faults!
