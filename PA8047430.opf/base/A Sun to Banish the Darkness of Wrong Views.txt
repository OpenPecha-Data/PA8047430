A Sun to Banish the Darkness of Wrong Views

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

You cut apart the web of conditioned existence,And burn away the thicket of abundant faults,Treasury
of Wisdom, Adamantine Sharpness,[1]At your feet I bow, and impart this message.

How pitiful it is that the clamour of hostilityToward Dharma from someone holding wrong views,Who
is cloaked in the darkness of conditioned existence,Should now be proliferating.

Clinging to one’s own view as paramountIs a defilement, to be discarded through meditation;Whereas
possession of the authentic viewNaturally releases the knots of attachment and aversionAnd
frees from the constraining cage of conceptual elaboration.

The protector Nāgārjuna and his heirs explainedThat all assertions of emptiness or non-emptinessAnd
the like are forms of conceptual construct.Thus to judge Old and New teachings and
adherentsAs good or bad, and to praise one’s own sideWhile disparaging that of othersIs the
tradition of ignoble people.

The gentle lord and second buddha,Lobzang Drakpa ablaze in splendour,Upheld the lineage traditionOf
the peerless Jowo [Atiśa] and his heirs.He led a pure liberational life;The Buddha’s
Words arose for him as personal instructions;And he understood how all teachings are mutually
compatible.Universal impartiality and benevolenceIs thus the tradition of this lineage.Having
entered this very tradition,Then to act in a way that conflicts with itIs to bring
injury upon the teachings.

The fact that Padmākara of OḍḍiyānaAnd the divinely eminent DīpaṃkāraBelonged to one and the
same wisdom-streamIs clearly stated in the Book of Kadam.And the great Lord Tsongkhapa’s
guruLekyi Dorje,[2]In his Great Aural Lineage VajrapāṇiAnd the Supreme Medicinal Nectar Replies,[3]Agrees
with the intent of Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen.Paṇchen Lobzang Chökyi Gyaltsen,Ngawang
Lobzang Gyatso and othersHave practised profound Nyingma teachings.Other great learned
and accomplished masters tooStudied the Ancient Translations’ dharma-treasuryOf kama
and terma and brought benefit to beings.The Gendenpas have made treasure teachings,Such as
the Most Secret Wrathful Hayagrīva[4]And the Kyergang pure vision Hayagrīva,[5]The core of
their tradition of secret practice.For these reasons and on account of reliable histories,Valid
textual sources and multiple logical arguments,One should never be hostile to the
supreme Ancient Translations,Either to its profound teachings or to its followers.

Nobody should object to a statementPromoting the greatness of one’s own system.But to feel deep
hostility yourselfOr to introduce it in othersIs to enter a wrong path and discourage
faith;It is to incur a grave burden of wrong,And to create a cause for evil destinies and
the hells.Thus, it is only wise to be cautious.

For most noble people[6]It is befitting to accord with conduct of the noble,And through the
wonder of altruistic intention,To bring benefit and happiness to the teachings and beings.


Sacred speech carved on stone,[7]Tsa-tsas, prayer flags and wind-powered wheels—To be touched
by the same breeze that passes themWill plant the seed of liberation.Such virtuous practices
should not be prevented.

The seven-day ceremonies based on the forty-nine day periodClearly explained in the Medicine
Sūtra, Purification Tantra and so on, [8]As well as the life-story of the Oḍḍiyāna Guru,The
Chronicles of Padma,The Guru’s secret Siddhi mantra,The Peaceful and Wrathful deities and
so on—To suppress such practices and teachingsWould surely have damaging repercussions.The
same logic would render it inadmissible to reciteThe name mantra invoking the wisdom mindOf
one’s own root guru,Or to perform the visualization and recitationFor all the deities
that originate in the maṇḍala of Guhyasamāja.Take heed, therefore, with body, speech and
mind.

For each town, monastery and patronTo perform recitation, offering and praise,Each according
to their own very system,For as many ancient traditions as exist,Is extremely virtuous and
auspicious.

To follow the nonsense of Phabongkha,[9]And cast aside tradition only to introduceAll manner
of newfangled practicesWill only bring unhappiness to the world.

The teachings these days are in decline.This is an age of strife based on degeneration.What
good, then, could there be in argumentBorn of sectarian attachment and aversion? It is futile!Remain,
therefore, in the space of the middle way.

Through the virtue of this, may all living beingsDevelop renunciation and bodhicitta in their
minds.May the wealth of their authentic view increase.May they perfect the two accumulation,
purify obscurations,And swiftly attain the level of the two kāyas.

Thus, this was imparted by an inveterately idle, dharmaless wanderer who has developed faith
in all the teachings of the victorious Buddha. May it be a source of immense benefit for
the world. Sarva maṅgalam.
