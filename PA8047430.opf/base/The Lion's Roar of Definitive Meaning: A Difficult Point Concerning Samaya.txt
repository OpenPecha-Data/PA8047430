The Lion's Roar of Definitive Meaning

A Difficult Point Concerning Samaya

by Khenpo Yönten Gönpo

The great, vajra-like body, speech and mindAre originally and spontaneously perfect, unconditioned.If
you realize this truth, the nature that is equality,Then thoughts, ideas and perceptions
are utterly pure.All the vows that exist are contained within this,And all remain
perfectly pure.

This is the secret of the enlightened body, speech and mindOf all the buddhas;It is the samaya
beyond transgression or impairment.In reference to the mental capacities of beings to be
trained,This is known by the term "beyond maintenance".

The enlightened activity of all the buddhasIs the great action that is non-action.Therefore,
those who fail to realize this definitive meaning,And who give credence to ordinary thoughts
and ideasWill impair their samaya and fall into infernal realms.

In view of this, the profound texts,The great secret tantras, say:"If you fail to understand
these works,However much you might guard, impairments will occur.And it will be exceedingly
difficult to escapeThe experiences of infernal realms, so terrifying,And the sufferings
of saṃsāra, so intolerable."

To put the same point the opposite way:To know that all phenomenaArise without truly arisingIs
also the samaya, the activity —I wonder: is it not genuinely so?
