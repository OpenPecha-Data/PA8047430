Concise Spiritual Advice

by Sera Khandro

How incredible!

I bow downbefore the single wisdom form of all the buddhasgone before, present now, and still
to come:our guide, Dudul Wangchuk Lingpa,[1]who is none other than Rigdzin Kunkyong Lingpa.May
we embrace the Buddha’s teachings that inspire usto practice the essential sublime
Dharma nowwhen we are enjoying excellent human lives,so hard to come by and blessed with freedoms
and advantages.Recognizing that the phenomena of cyclic existenceare impermanent and
illusoryhelps us to loosen our ties of attachment and clinging to them,such that alone,
we can reflect upon the factthat the time of death comes without warning.Then we can actualize
the true wisdom deity within our own minds.Buddha taught the connection between actions
and their resultsto be unfailing and undeceiving,enabling us to understand how we experience
the resultsof our own prior goodness and negativity.So, with certainty about this,
let us be thorough and precisein what we do and do not do.Saṃsāra is like a putrid swamp,where
we muck around in the sludge of insufferable misery.Think about this. Then go alone to
the solitudes of the mountainsand resolve your mind.Pray to your master and to the Three
Jewels,and strive to be wholesome – physically, verbally and mentally.Work to gather merit
and wisdom by purifying your obscurations,and protecting and freeing the lives of beings
in danger.If you don’t help yourself now while you are capable,no one will be there to liberate
you in the future.So, leave behind family and close friends,and stop cherishing the
wealth you’ve collectedand even your precious body.When your consciousness journeysthrough
the long treacheries that lie beyond death,the best protection is your master, the supreme
jewel,so, pray with devotion and make aspirations to see everything purely.Recite and spread
the six syllablesto benefit yourself and others.Negative friends are poisonous, like
a lair of snakes,and pull you and others down into gloominess,so, stay by yourself, alone
in the solitude of the mountains,and with the view, steady your mind by the iron hook of
mindfulness.Use meditation to develop confidence in action and resultsand pay close attention
to the details of what to do and what not to do.In your behavior, love beings from all
six realms as your own children.The ground is to stabilize bodhicitta – the foundation.The
path is to realize the wisdom deity and the teachings, for the benefit of beings,and the
result brings yourself and others to the pure land of liberation.

A beggar woman named Tārā who roams in saṃsāra wrote this to fulfill the request of one filled
with devotion, the excellent Jigme. May it be virtuous.
