Advice for Pema Rangdrol[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Not doing any harm to sentient beings,Guarding ethical commitments without hypocrisy,And thoroughly
training one’s own mind—This is the essence of the practice of individual liberation.[2]


Recognizing all beings, present throughout the whole of space, as one’s parents,Generating the
noblest intention to strive for others’ benefit,And perfectly carrying out the activity
of a bodhisattva—This is the practice related to the bodhisattva vow.

Sealing all sights, sounds and awareness as great primordial wisdom,Persevering in the paths
of generation and completion without grasping or attachment,And holding dear the vows and
samayas and devotion for the guru—This, in a nutshell, is the essence of the mantrayāna vows.


The view of non-elaboration, the meditation of non-grasping,The action of self-settling, and
the fruition of self-liberation are crucial.In the experience of natural ease, beyond intellectual
speculation,To settle naturally is the key to Mahāmudrā and the Great Perfection.[3]


Chökyi Lodrö spoke this essential advice for his own student Pema Rangdrol. Siddhirastu.
