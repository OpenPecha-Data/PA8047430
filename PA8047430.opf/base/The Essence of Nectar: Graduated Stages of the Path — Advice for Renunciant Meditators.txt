The Essence of Nectar: Graduated Stages of the Path

Advice for Renunciant Meditators

by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo

Masters whose kindness is unequalled,Wisdom kāyas of the victors and their offspring—With heartfelt
faith I prostrate to you,And here reveal a few pieces of profound advice.Whoever renounces
the world,Aspiring to achieve the highest enlightenment,Must initially seek out a
teacher of the spiritual path,And serve that spiritual friend in three ways.According to
their advice, stabilise your mindBy knowing what to adopt and what to avoid,Apply yourself
to receiving and contemplating the teachings,And awaken the wisdom that comes from meditation.By
not transgressing your vowed training,You’ll achieve the state beyond regret,From
which, it is said, single-pointed concentration andThe perfect discrimination of Dharma will
arise.Through lesser, excellent and extraordinary applicationOf the three higher trainings,You
may bring about the result of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas or complete enlightenment;Seeing
this, perfect your view and conduct.Initially, use your intellect to analyse
thoroughlyThe imagined and co-emergent self;You’ll not find it as a naturally established,Singular
or multifaceted entity.Furthermore, the objects this self regards,When broken down
into gross and subtle, and in directional parts,Are found to be mere conceptual imputations,Each
designated with its respective name.The various perceptions which grasp at these
objects,Like the experiences and experiencer in a dream,Are all dependent on what is actually
false,So how could they themselves be real?Even the experience of this wisdom of non-dualityMust
be investigated with the reasoning of the three times.Without grasping at arising,
cessation or centre,Free yourself from elaboration’s extremes.Objects to be negated—all
elaborations—Are also primordially and naturally unobservable;So the negation—freedom from
elaborations—Is also not truly established.Similarly, by investigating objects in the
same wayYou’ll come to find the subject which is beyond expression—The genuine expanse, an
inconceivable place of rest.This is what we call ‘settling meditation’.Should you wish to
approach the state of Buddhahood—By means of compassion’s illusory nature—For the sake of
all dreamlike beings,Who have not realised the nature through this approach,You should swiftly
achieve the most excellent wisdom,By taking the highest vajra-vehicle,Which is distinguished
by its methods and isThe earnest endeavour of the learned.Nāḍī, prāṇa and bindu—wisdom’s
elements—For them to awaken into the resultant four kāyas,You should know how to plant
continually the seedsOf the four empowerments, of both cause and path.With the condition
of the stages of generation and completion,And the close friend of the mantric precepts,Combined
with the secondary cause of conduct;You’ll find the state of union within this
lifetime.With the correct realisation of emptiness—Averse to the extremes of elaboration—If
you can arrive at the essence of great blissYou’ll come to see the indivisible nature of
samsara and nirvana.With your gross body, speech and mindPerfected as deity, mantra and dharmakāya,It’s
certain that you’ll reverse the common bewilderment ofBirth and decay within
the three worlds.To uproot the attachment of any clinging,Through the yoga of the subtle
nāḍī, prāṇa and bindu,Activate the vital points of the subtle bodyAnd directly induce the
wisdom of great bliss.When bliss and emptiness come together,Through this extremely subtle
union,The clear light of training and no-more-training,You’ll achieve the state of Vajradhara,
with its seven aspects of union.There is no need to say much, so, in essence:Through
thoroughly disregarding the affairs of this lifeAnd striving to reach the state of liberation,You
form the basis for all subsequent paths.The realisation of the way of abiding—the
insubstantial nature—And the mode of appearances—unobstructed dependent arising—Conjoined
with love for all beings,Comprise the actual paths.The ultimate, the wisdom of the natural
state,And the conventional, the generation and completion stages,Naturally arising in accordance
with the stages of method,Comprise the path’s exalted Dharmas.Finally, through the
practice of guru yoga,All ordinary subjects and objectsArise as the great-seal of fervent
devotion:This is the excellent life-pillar of the path.Eh ma! By this fine, short explanationOf
the meaning of the vast and profound,May all, both animate and inanimate,Arise as
the web of magical apparition!

As requested by the yogi of the supreme vehicle, Chöying Palden, who is dedicated to the single-pointed
pursuit of accomplishing the heart [of spiritual practice] and has caused the
lotus bud of intelligence to bloom with the nectar of perceiving the all-pervading vajra-queen’s
wisdom and, as such, is fearless in his understanding of many points of the outer and
inner sciences, this was composed by the ignoramus, the untrained and bewildered ascetic,
Jamyang Khyentse, who wrote down whatever came into his mind, at the isolated spot of Jangchup
Chöling.

Sarvadā maṅgalam!
