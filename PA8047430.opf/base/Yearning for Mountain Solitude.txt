Yearning for Mountain Solitude[1]

by Patrul Rinpoche

Having seen the bewildering scope of never-ending activities,All so unnecessary and frivolous,Within
delusory perception of this world, this city of saṃsāra,Abu's attention turns to
the solitude of the mountains.[2]

Having seen the constant frenzy of actitvity,The futile clamour of busyness and distractionIn
the dealings of the monastic community,Abu's attention turns to the solitude of the mountains.


Anyone I look at is inexorably approaching death;Anything I consider involves a denial of mortality.Having
seen such disenchanting extravagance,Abu's attention turns to the solitude
of the mountains.

Any friends I make increase my attachment and aversion;Any form of interaction involves dishonesty
and deception.Having seen how companions lack the conditions for virtue,Abu's attention
turns to the solitude of the mountains.

Throughout the three realms, the hostile kleśas go on deceiving;Among the six classes, the wheel
of distraction continues to turn.Having seen these means of engendering further suffering,Abu's
attention turns to the solitude of the mountains.

O Guru, unfailing protector, and Three Jewels,When I reach a place of retreat, inspire me with
the fortitude to remain there.Grant your blessings and enable me to settle in the solitude
of the mountains,Somewhere that provides physical and vocal isolation,And thereby inspire
a true solitude of the mind.
