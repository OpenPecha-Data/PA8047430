Advice for Nubla Kunzang Chöpel[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

In devotion, I bow down before the lotus feetOf the glorious guru and present this brief advice.


Remember impermanence and death,Strive to adopt and avoid certain actions and their effects,And
reflect on the trials of saṃsāra.With a determination to escape conditioned existence,Make
the most of this free, advantaged opportunityBy assiduously exerting yourself in the
Dharma.

At the root of the Mahāyāna pathIs to train the mind in bodhicittaAnd conquer thoughts of self-grasping.Devote
yourself to service for the sake of sentient beings.Continually offer prayers
of excellent aspiration.

Generate intense faith and devotionFor the guru of the Vajra VehicleAnd maintain extremely pure
samaya—this is crucial.Supplicate with fervent devotion,Receive empowerment, blend your
mind with the guru’s wisdom,And investigate the arising, remaining and ceasingOf this, your
own flickering deluded mind.Determine that it is without basis or origin.Its non-arising
is the dharmakāya;Its non-remaining is the sambhogakāya;And its unceasing potential is
the nirmāṇakāya—All are spontaneously present within mind’s basic condition.Emptiness and
clarity are inseparably united—Unspoilt by thinking, free from dualistic grasping.Do not modify
or transform anything but settle naturally.Undistracted and free from grasping—this
is the key to meditation.Allowing whatever arises to be freed by itself—the key to action.Actualizing
what is perfect within the ground—the key to fruition.

If you can combine these four—view, meditation, action and fruition—In this way, so that they
are one and indivisible,And you know how to merge all forms of equipoise,Such as deity visualization,
mantra recitation, and the like,As well as all non-meditative states, within
this expanse,You’ll realize the meaning of the Indivisibility of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa,Perfectly
master the tenets of philosophy, complete the path,And attain the level of a Vajra Holder.


Thus, the one called Chökyi Lodrö wrote this merely to avoid turning down a request from Nubla
Kunzang Chöpel, a holder of the three trainings.
