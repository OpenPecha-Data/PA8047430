Advice for a Sincere Disciple

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Homage to the noble gurus!

Remember that this physical support, free and advantaged,Will not endure but will perish at
some point.Having reflected on the tribulations of saṃsāra,Remember to adopt and avoid actions
according to their effects.Visualize the guru, embodying the Three Jewels, upon your
crown,And take refuge with confident faith.Recognise all beings of the three realms as your
parents.It’s crucial that you cultivate love, compassion and bodhicitta.Apply yourself assiduously
to accumulation and purification,And pray to the gracious guru.With the generation
phase, purify attachment to ordinary perception,And with the perfection phase, purify
attachment to the deities’ magnificence.The profound crucial point for both of theseIs not
to alter the mind but to experience the union of clarity and emptinessAnd settle undistractedly
without fixation—this is the key.Recite at all times Samantabhadra’s Aspiration to
Good Actions,And seal all sources of virtue with dedication, I beg you.

Thus, Chökyi Lodrö offered this message
To a sincere disciple. May it prove virtuous!
