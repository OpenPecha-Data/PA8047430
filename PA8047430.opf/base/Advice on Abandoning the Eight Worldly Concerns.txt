Advice on Abandoning the Eight Worldly Concerns

by Nyala Pema Dündul

A ho! Listen well, all you fortunate, supreme disciples of excellent karma!

Gain and loss, happiness and unhappiness,Fame and insignificance, praise and blame—These are
what we call “the eight worldly concerns.”

Those who cling to the duality of good and bad, and feel pleasure and frustration,Can't even
be called practitioners of non-dual self-liberation,Bound as they are by the chains of attachment
to the eight worldly concerns.

Whatever happens, whether it appears good or bad, pleasurable or painful,Is just like the ten
similes of illusion — recognise this!And, in a state of perfection, transcending the ordinary
mind, and beyond words, thought and description,Rest in the expanse of the view, beyond
the limitations of hope and fear.

This advice on abandoning the eight worldly concerns,Was put together by the old beggar Padma,For
a group of students who had repeatedly requested it.

Through this, may my followers, yogis intent upon enlightenment,Be free from even so much as
a single thoughtThat is deceived by the māra of the eight worldly concerns!
