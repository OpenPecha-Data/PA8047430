Necessary Advice

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Sacred refuge, root guru, care for me!Someone like me has no advice to impart,But in the words
of the masters of the past:

As a means to escape this world of saṃsāra
Train your mind with the four mind-changers.

All acts that we accumulate—good, bad, great, small—Do not go to waste but ripen when the time
comes.So do not err: embrace virtue and avoid misdeeds.

The vital axis for all Dharma is bodhicitta.Cultivate the four immeasurablesAnd exchange your
happiness for others’ sufferingTime and again, I beg you.

To realize the ground, sugatagarbha,Continually strive to purify obscurations and gather accumulations.


Meditate on the profound path of guru yoga
With faith, devotion and pure samaya.

Know that the guru is your very own mind.Realising how the mind’s delusory thoughts are unbornLays
bare the pure awareness of the true natural state,Wherein lie the three kāyas, beyond
merger and separationAs the indivisibility of clear awareness and emptiness.Rest in the
evenness of stillness, movement and awareness.Discard all hope and fear, all attempts to
reject or cultivate.Upon the ground, unaltered and beyond elaboration,Settle in the path that
is non-grasping non-meditation,And as fruition, meet the true dharmakāya face of Mahāmudrā
and the Great Perfection,Through which the citadel of the three realms will be emptied.


Thus, in response to a request from Paksam Gyatso,These words were offered by the reckless,Stubbornly
indolent one called Chökyi Lodrö.

Through this virtue, may all attain supreme awakening!
