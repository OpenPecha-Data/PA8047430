Instructions on the Fivefold Mahāmudrā

by the Omniscient Chökyi Jungné

Namaḥ Śrī Gurave

The ever-present Immutable Being, Vajrasattva,Remains unchanged amidst the endless display of
saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—I bow to this original, innate, and uncontrived guru,As I write these
pith instructions on Mahāmudrā.

For the preliminaries, 1) train in bodhicitta,2) Meditate on the yidam deity, and 3) on the
guru.For the main part, 4) settle within Mahāmudrā,And 5) seal with dedications at the end.Practicing
all these within a single sessionIs renowned as the Fivefold Mahāmudrā.

1) First, train in bodhicitta—the heart of awakening.When it comes to the cultivation of relative
bodhicitta,There is aspirational bodhicitta, which is like wishing to go somewhere,And
applied bodhicitta, which is like actually going there.

Of these two, aspirational bodhicitta is seeingThat not a single sentient being has not been
your parent.Despite wanting happiness, they don’t know how to be happy.They only act in ways
that are negative, and so wander in saṃsāra.Therefore always cultivate a love and compassionThat
includes everyone, praying from the bottom of your heart,“I myself will accomplish
awakening for their benefit!”

Applied bodhicitta is the cause of buddhahood.It refers to the six or the ten perfections,which
can be subsumed within the two accumulations:Discipline is the accumulation of merit,
and insight is the accumulation of wisdom;Both are included in calm abiding meditation.Thinking,
“I will practice these two without laziness,”Promise to practice them one-pointedly.


2) Second, meditate upon your body as the yidam deity.It’s fine whether or not you have a special
yidam;You can meditate upon yourself as Four-Armed Avalokiteśvara.Seeing appearances,
sounds and thought as deity, mantra, and samādhi,Take them onto the path, casting off attachment
to them as ordinary.

3) Third, visualize your root guru seated upon a lotus and moonatop your crown as you visualize
yourself as the deity.He[1] is Great Vajradhara, embodiment of all Three Jewels,Surrounded
by the gurus of the Oral Lineage, the Kagyü.

Despite the compassionate power of the Victors of the three times,Without a guru, disciples’
minds will not ripen.This is especially true for the unruly folks of these destitute times,When
the force of the Victors has declined.

Beginning with this one wholesome thought,Consider how they help us in uncountable ways through
their skillful methods.Therefore, with the sublime perspective that sees the guruAs equal
or superior to all buddhas, single-pointedly pray to him.

After this, once you have taken the empowerments three times,The guru melts into light and dissolves
into you.At that moment, consider his three vajras and your three doorsTo be indivisible,
and relax into uncontrived naturalness.

4) Fourth is the main part: training in Mahāmudrā.First, there’s what’s to be understood; and
second, what is to be practiced.First, the nature of all that appears and exists within
saṃsāra and nirvāṇaHas from the beginning been the utterly pure dharmadhātu.

Profoundly clear, non-dual, beyond extremes, and uncompounded,This is what we call “Original
Buddha,”The causal continuum, the natural state of Mahāmudrā,And the tathāgatagarbha—buddha
nature.

This utterly pure nature, which is like space,Is perceived as “I” and “mine”Through the fleeting
movement of discursive thought.And so, beginning with ignorance, the processOf interdependence
unfolds as the wheel of saṃsāra.The guru introduces you to its true character,And
when you understand that the root of saṃsāraIs grasping to the self, and the root of that
is thinking,Then just as when a fire is extinguished and its smoke naturally ceases,All
discursive thoughts are relinquished in the emptiness in which one trains.

This supreme path to liberation holds methods for realizing just that.In tantra it’s taught
in many ways—the development stage, training the prāṇa energies,Blazing and dripping, and
so on—while the sūtras teach calm abidingWith various supports and gaining certainty through
insight, and so on.Why so? Because without realizing emptinessIt will be impossible to
transcend saṃsāra and so emerge awakened.Therefore, it is said, “Whatever Dharma the Victor
taughtflows into and comes down to emptiness.”The Noble Ones shall be liberated by meditating
upon emptiness,And the other meditations are taught for this purpose, it is said.

Abandoning thoughts in their meditation,Some non-Buddhists cultivate the mistaken idea,“I am
the nonconceptual Supreme Self”;Others refute the “samādhi of non-thought from Hashang’s
tradition,”When it’s just the calm abiding of beginners;While long chains of intellectual
thoughtsAre hailed as meditation by those pining after future fame—All such impure meditations
should be totally abandoned.

You should gain experiential instruction, rather than settling for words—Pith advice that adorns
the lineage of the Buddha’s teachings.Those with the good fortune to gain experience
through such instructionShould unify their samādhi with discerning wisdom.

This is known as taking buddha nature as the path,The continuum of skillful methods, the truth
of the path,And the accumulation of wisdom.Furthermore, samādhi refers to calm abiding
meditationThat remains one-pointed and without conceptual thought.The luminous essence of
mind, undeluded and beyond thought,Is the way all things truly are.To gain certainty, from
the depths of your very being,In the realization that all that could possibly exist is unborn
simplicityIs the insight referred to here as discerning wisdom.When you settle evenly
in both calm abiding and insight,They have but a single essence—a “unity.”For as long as
meditation and post-meditation have yet to mix,Analytical wisdom during post-meditation is
most important.

In the sūtras, special insight is likened to eyes,And calm abiding compared to legs.Without
the eyes seeing, the legs will not knowOr understand the path to be taken on their own;And
yet without legs, how could one walk this path?Possess both eyes and legs, therefore, the
teachings say.

Such a meditator discovers that within the sky-like space of reality,It is impossible, naturally,
for there to be any stains,And yet the temporary emotional and cognitive stainsWill
gradually clear away like clouds.The various divisions of the ten grounds,The five paths,
or Śāntipa’s system of One-Pointedness, Simplicity,One-Taste and Non-Meditation, and so forth,Are
presented on this basis.As it is said, “When the stains and their imprintsAre utterly
exhausted, that is complete awakening.”

When one has realized the all-pervasive dharmakāya,There is the second fruit, rūpakāya, which
comes from merit.These two arise as effortlessly as light from the sun.This is called the
fruitional continuum, fruitional buddhahood,And sugatagarbha endowed with twofold purity.The
Buddha’s teachings on this topic are widely renowned!

Second, when it comes to that which is to be practiced,There are the two means of resting.Place
the body at rest in the sevenfold posture of Vairocana,And rest the mind easily, without
changing anything.In the naked recognition of this present awareness,Don’t follow after
thoughts of the pastOr entertain thoughts of the future.When thoughts abound, recognize that
which proliferates them.Let it be as it is—without any judgement, acceptance, or rejection.


If you haven’t attained the level of One-Pointedness,Then focus on whichever support you likeFor
taking hold of the mind, such as a stick, a pebble,A deity’s image, a syllable, or anything
else.When your mind gradually becomes somewhat stable through such meditation,Practice
in short sessions, many times.

First, combine your entire sixfold sensory experienceInto a single point of mindfulness,Then,
in an instant, completely relax and let go,Like slicing through a knot with a sharp blade.Apart
from simply not being distracted from this state,Give up all points of focus—thoughts
about “meditating on this,”A meditation or a meditator, presence or absence, “this is
it” or “this isn’t it,”Bliss, clarity, non-thought, emptiness, or any of the like.

As long as you simply do not stray from this mindful state,Your awareness, never grasping at
a self, may go wherever it likes,Like a crow soaring above a ship at sea.Based on this training,
the apparent objects of the six senses,Pain, emotions, and thoughts may all be taken
as supportsAnd blended with your meditation.They will not cloud your samādhi but increase
it.

In brief, when training to stabilize your calm abiding,Too much relaxation will lead to drowsiness,While
too much tightness will lead to agitation and difficulty sitting still.The quality
of tightness only torments the mind,And overcome by doubts, you will not gain One-Pointedness.So,
neither too tight nor too loose, meditate with joy and certainty.Attachment
to any experience of bliss, clarity, or emptinessWill make you stray into saṃsāra.So without
grasping, just recognize your natural faceAnd remain there without any judgement whatsoever.


When you are given the introduction to special insight,It is as the protector Maitreya says
in The Ornament of the Sūtras:

Once you discern that there is naught apart from mind,Then you will realize that even mind is
emptiness.The clever understand that neither truly exist,And so know the state of dharmadhātu
besides.

Through valid citation, reasoning, and experience,We may gain conviction that this is so.Firstly,
this entire miasma of thought we experienceHas no basis apart from just this very mind,So
know it to be like things in a dream.

But how is it, you may wonder,That substantial things like firmness, wetness, warmth, and such,Could
be produced by an insubstantial mind?It is like the legend of the cowherd who willedVisible
horns from his head through meditationOr the mantrin who undertook nāga practiceAnd
so transformed into Apalāla the Nāga King.Or when one beholds the yidam deityThrough
stability in the development stage.If such things can manifest in a single life,Then what
is there to stop all these experiences from manifestingOut of the bad habits formed over beginningless
time?

Gods will see a cup of water as ambrosiaWhile hungry ghosts see it as pus and blood.Land spirits
will see a mountainAs their own lovely mansion,While humans see it as ordinary stone.All
this goes to show that such thingsHold no truth apart from their mere appearance to the
mind.

Once you gain certainty that apparent objects are mind,Then come to know that mind as well is
emptiness.Mind has no concrete existence, not so much as an atom’s worth.Why? When the condition
of an object appears,We have a distinct experience of knowing itThat arises and ceases
with each moment.This is what we categorize in terms of the eight collections of consciousness,But
if you dissect any of these, any basis for them disappears,For that which we
call the basis-of-all is nothing but a name.Just as a thirsty animal will chase after the
waterSeen in a mirage, where none exists,This utterly mistaken mind grasps at a self,And
grows more and more confused as it gathers bad karma.

This is why in the Sūtra Collection the Victor clearly states:“There is no mind within the mind.”While
mind isn’t there, it’s taught that“Its nature is luminous cognizance.”Why? Because
what we call the “mind”Is just the eight collections of consciousness,And these are but
thoughts, by nature confused.But the “nature of mind, luminous cognizance,”Is thought-free,
unconfused, self-knowing gnosis.This is not gained anew through meditation,Nor bestowed
by the compassion of the Victors.It is the beginningless causal continuum, our natural birthright.


Through the power of gathering the accumulations,Purifying obscurations, training, and through
the blessingsOf your guru’s pointing out, you come to see for yourselfThat you already
possess this. As it is said:

It is therefore unspeakable by others, but always with you,Yet cannot be found anywhere at all.It
must be known through the timely methods of the glorious guru,And through one’s own
merit.

As such, it is ever-present,Free from both perceived objectsAnd the perceiving mind.Pure like
the sky, with no restrictions or bias.If you are able to rest in composure in this unityOf
calm abiding and special insight, free from complexity, for even for a moment,Then “the
darkness of many aeons is thereby defeated.”

This Mahāmudrā free from complexityIs the essential view of both Sūtra and Tantra.This is explained
to be the single meaning of the viewEspoused unanimously by the great Indian commentators,Such
as when masters like Nāgārjuna state,“There is no view superior to the Middle
Way,”Or as in the passage from The Torch of the Three Methods,That begins, “The meaning is
the same…”[2]What then is the point of receivingHundreds of empowerments and bestowing them
on othersIf you don’t practice the meaning of the fourth empowerment, Mahāmudrā,But cover
your ears when you even hear its name?How is that different from the karma of a lord of
the Desire Realm?

So when you practice this yoga of unity,If you grasp to the meditation moods of bliss, clarity,
or non-thought,These will lead you astray into the Desire, Form, and Formless Realms.So
do not grasp or block them, but just allow for the continued presence of the natural state.Moreover,
whether it’s presuming intellectual understanding to be enough,Or destroying
appearances and imagining them to be empty,Or blocking of any kind of thought, however minute—These
should be treated as frightful abysses.Give up the intellectual posturing of dry
scholars,Such as clinging to the faults of whatever thought may arise,And simply allow for
the unaltered, natural flow of whatever arises.

When diligently practicing according to this tradition,Which is adorned with such experiential
oral instructionsAs “relax and let be within undistracted non-meditation,”Gnosis will shine
from within your heart, misconceptions will fall away,And the signs and qualities of
the path will increase, even if you wish otherwise.Like mercury that has fallen on the ground,You
will remain unsullied by the dust of the eight worldly concerns,And all the grandeur
of saṃsāra will seem as revulsive as poison.By understanding this key point of emptiness
and dependent origination’s unity,The benefit for oneself and others, wisdom and method
united, will spontaneously arise.When this happens, your “practice has arrived at the key
point.”

The threefold preliminaries above gather merit,While the main practice gathers wisdom.Therefore,
through these two accumulationsYou will attain the resultant two or threefold kāyas.Then,
when ground and path luminous cognizance mixLike the meeting of mother and child,This
is called perfect buddhahood.At this point, its empty essence is the dharmakāya,Its cognizant
nature is the sambhogakāya,Its unobstructed expression is the all-encompassing nirmāṇakāya,And
this total perfection is the kāya of great bliss.This is the supreme result of recognizing
your own face,The original natural state whose nature is these four kāyas—Thus,
it is taught to be “the fruition, beyond hope and fear.”

Fifth: Conclude by sealing the practice with dedications.Imagine that all the virtue there could
beIn the past, present, or future is all condensedInto the virtue amassed by your gathering
the two accumulationsWithin the maṇḍala of self-knowing buddha nature.Dedicate this
one-pointedly to all beings, yourself and others,Being quickly freed from the snare of saṃsāraAnd
attaining the state of Mahāmudrā, unified connate gnosis.Make this dedication from
within the state thatEmbraces the view of emptiness, with no reference to the three spheresOf
action, actor, and object of dedication.

Whatever great virtue you may accomplish,If it’s not embraced by the view purified of the three
spheres,It will become as the Victors describedIn the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras and
elsewhereAs like a blind man or food mixed with poison—It won’t serve as the flawless cause
of freedom.Therefore, take care at all timesTo plant the seed of awakeningEvery time you
practice the development and completion stagesOr whichever virtuous practice you exert yourself
in.

In this way a beginner may practiceAll these five elements in a single session.Once you practice
and gain familiarityWith the different stages of the main part,Such as focusing your
attention in calm abiding,You will not need any elaborate practice besidesThis yoga of unity.


Then, there are supplementary practices related to the different times of day.First, at dawn
comes the yoga of clarifying gnosis,Wherein immediately upon waking from sleepYou recognize
awareness, the unity of empty cognizanceUninterrupted by thoughts, and rest there evenly,Then
develop fierce compassion for all beingsWho do not realize this nature,And thereafter
begin your daily practice.This is the instruction for making a habit of your practice;It’s
excellent to begin your practice joyfully in this way.

During the daytime, the yoga of sealing the experiencesIs to seal and meditate upon all experiencesAs
being the confused mind, dreamlike,And by nature deluded.By viewing them as emptiness,
just like dreams that can’t be held as real,You will not be overpowered by delusionAnd
will refine the expression of awareness;This is the instruction for preparing for the
bardo.

During the morning and evening, the yoga of befriending luxuriesIs to have little attachment
to food and drink,Clothing, place, bedding, and so on,But to train in their use as reality
dissolving into itselfFrom within the state that knows their emptiness.If you are unable
to train like this,Then make use of things as though you were offering themTo the deities
and your guru.These are the instructions for perfecting the accumulationsAnd not being bound
by luxuries.

At nighttime, the yoga of withdrawing the senses into the basis-of-allIs to not follow after
the proliferationOf whatever deluded memories of the day may arise,But to look nakedly at
their very essence.This is the instruction for making a habit of practice at nighttime.

Late at night, the yoga of consciousness entering the vaseIs to pray to your guru, visualized
in your heart center,And then to completely cut through thoughtsAnd fall asleep while resting
evenly in the simplicity of reality.This is the instruction for blending mother and
child luminosityIn sleep and at the time of death.

At the moment of death, the yoga of wide open gnosisIs to sever your attachment to anything
at all,Confess all the faults of this and past lives,Then bring to mind all your own and others’
virtue,Rejoice in it, and dedicate it to great awakening.If you’re especially capable,
offer and give away your own aggregates,Remain decisively confident that your own mindfulnessIs
not born and does not die,And then let the stages of dissolution transpire as they
likeWhile resting evenly in the natural flow of Mahāmudrā,Free from any meditation or non-meditation,And
uncomplicated by many complex visualizations.This is the transference of
consciousnessWithin the wide open expanse of dharmakāya.This will close the doors to the
lower realms,And halt the perpetuation of samsāra in general,And the confusion of the bardo
in particular.This is the instruction for realizing death as dharmakāya.

for poeticsAt the behest of the minister of the great king of Dergé,The seasoned practitioner
