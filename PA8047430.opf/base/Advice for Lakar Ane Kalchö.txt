Advice for Lakar Ane Kalchö

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Homage to the guru!

Contemplate the four transformative topics, take refuge,And cultivate loving kindness, compassion
and bodhicitta.Assiduously purify your obscurations and accumulate merit.Meditate on
guru yoga as a means to receive blessings.Pray, receive empowerment, and blend your mind
with wisdom.

Investigate well the mind’s basis or origin.Settle the body without moving or fidgeting.Put
a stop to your speech and remain silent.Do not chase after thoughts in your mind.Allow any
movement to subside by itself.Breathe slowly and direct your gazeInto open space, and in
that momentAwareness will be space-like, insubstantial:Empty in essence, cognizant by nature,And
in its resonance, thought-free knowing.This is basis of all that arises, unobstructed
and open.Rest undistractedly in the experience of vivid clarity.Do not pursue thoughts
that manifest as expressions,But allow them to arise and subside by themselves.Regard all
phenomena as illusory.

When the time of death approachesLet go of all attachment and entanglement.Visualize your root
guru at your crown,And repeatedly eject your awareness,In the form of a syllable A, into
the guru’s heart.If you’re able to pass away in such a stateYou will take rebirth in a pure
realm.But it’s through training now and becoming familiarThat you’ll be able to effect
the transference.

It’s crucial that you regularly recite dharma practices.And, with bodhicitta and a noble intention,Dedicate
virtue and make prayers of aspiration.
