Advice for Jamyang Losal[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Aho!
Son, all phenomena are mental projections.
Sickness, pain and pleasure are concepts.

When you thoroughly investigate conceptual thought,You find that it’s beyond arising, abiding
and ceasing, and neither comes nor goes.

The mind-as-such, in which clarity, awareness and emptinessAre indivisibly united, is the guru
and the yidam.

Within the view that recognizes precisely thisDo not be bound by the fetters of grasping.Out
of an experience of this view beyond conceptual elaboration,Apply yourself to the meditation
in which whatever arises – Generation, perfection, and so on – is its unobstructed expression.


The king of all forms of obstacle-removal and enhancementIs the profound path of guru yoga.It
is vital, therefore, that you focus upon it with devotion.

This I impart to my heart-son Khen Rinpoche Jamyang Losal.
